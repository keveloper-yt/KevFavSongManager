			<p>
				Hi, I'm Kevin. I made this tool to give chat influence over
				background music. When you're active in chat, there is a chance
				one of your favorited songs will be queued. Your songs will
				only be considered if you have favorited at least 10 different
				songs.
			</p>

			<p>
				Authentication is powered by Twitch in order to associate your
				preferences with a given Twitch account.

            <h1>FAQ</h1>

			<h2>Why is 'x' song not here even though songs from the same album are included?</h2>
			<p>
				There are 4 common reasons I might not include a specific song
				or songs from an album:
				- The track in question has different usage rights.
				- I can't find a good standalone source for the track.
				- The song is especially short/long.
				- I find a song particularly annoying or unfitting for stream.
			</p>

			<h2>The preview link for a song is broken! (or some other metadata error)</h2>
			<p>
				Please let me know in Twitch chat when I'm live.
			</p>

			<h2>Can you add 'x' song?</h2>
			<p>
				Depends. If the usage rights for the song permit streaming or
				permit commercial use, I can look into it. Adding more songs
				can take a lot of manual work though, so it's not something
				I'm keen to do often.
			</p>

			<h2>How can I view my favorited songs?</h2>
			<p>
				The library is sortable by column when clicking the columns in
				the top row. If you click on the favorites column you can sort
				by favorites. When sorted in ascending order, your favorites
				should appear starting from the top of page 1.
